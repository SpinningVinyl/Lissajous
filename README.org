* Lissajous

This is a silly program for Windows that displays beautiful curves called "Lissajous figures" on your screen.

The program runs in full screen. Press any key to exit.

Written in Basic because we all know that Basic is most suitable for Windows application development, right? (Just kidding.)

Initially I wanted to make a screensaver but changed my mind after discovering that it's impossible to make a QB64 program that works with multi-monitor setups (or could at least detect multiple monitors) without messing with the Windows API.

** New in version 220116
- Full-color mode instead of 256 colors.
- The curves are now displayed using color gradients instead of a limited selection of solid colors.
- The program now cycles through different values of phase shift between /x/ and /y/ in addition to different frequency ratios.

** Requirements
- [[https://qb64.org/][QB64]]
- A moderately modern version of Windows. While QB64 is also available for Linux and macOS, this application has not been tested in either Linux or macOS.
